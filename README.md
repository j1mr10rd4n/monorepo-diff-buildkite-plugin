# Monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin [![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/9e787df12fec365265a5284e0ae1c87c816aca648d8fd8f468.svg)](https://buildkite.com/buildkite/monorail-plugin-monorepo)

This Monorepo plugin will assist you in triggering pipelines, as well as run commands in your CI by watching folders in your `monorepo`.

Check out this post to learn more about [**How to set up Continuous Integration for monorepo using Buildkite**](https://adikari.medium.com/set-up-continuous-integration-for-monorepo-using-buildkite-61539bb0ed76).

## Usefulness of the monorepo

A monorepo is a single, version-controlled code repository that houses multiple independent projects, offering benefits such as flexibility, streamlined management, and reduced tracking of changes and dependencies across multiple repositories.

This approach allows teams to:

- Reduce overhead associated with duplicating code for microservices.
- Easily maintain and monitor the entire codebase.

Check out the [example monorepo source code](https://github.com/buildkite/monorepo-example).

## Using the plugin

If the version number is not provided then the most recent version of the plugin will be used. Do not use version number as `master` or any branch names.

### `watch`

It defines a list of paths or path to monitor for changes in the monorepo. It checks to see if there is a change to the subfolders specified in the path

### `path`

A path or a list of paths to be watched, This part specifies which directory should be monitored. It can also be a glob pattern. For example specify `path: "**/*.md"` to match all markdown files. A list of paths can be provided to trigger the desired pipeline or run command or even do a pipeline upload.

When `regex_paths: true` is set on the watch block, paths are treated as regular expressions instead of globs.

### `skip_path`

A path or a list of paths to be ignored, which can be an exact path, or a glob.

This is intended to be used in conjunction with `path`, and allows omitting specific paths from being matched.

When `regex_paths: true` is set, skip paths are also treated as regular expressions.

### `except_path`

A path or a list of paths to prevent the paths listed to be matched, which can be an exact path, or a glob.

This is intended to be used in conjunction with `path`, and allows for creating exclusive matches with simpler rules when several files are modified in the same execution.

When `regex_paths: true` is set, except paths are also treated as regular expressions.

### `regex_paths`

Set to `true` to treat `path`, `skip_path`, and `except_path` as regular expressions instead of globs. Uses [regexp2](https://github.com/dlclark/regexp2) which supports full PCRE syntax including lookaheads and lookbehinds.

Regex matching is unanchored: a pattern matches if it occurs anywhere in the file path, not only at the start. For example, `path: "src/.*"` matches `vendor/src/main.go` as well as `src/main.go`. Anchor with `^` (and `$` where needed) to match the full path, as in the example above.

This is useful when the paths you want to match would require many glob patterns to express. For example, to match all TypeScript/JavaScript source files under `src/` while excluding test files, snapshots, and specific directories:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "^src/(?!pulumi|ci-generators|desktop|mobile|test)(?!.*\\.test\\.)(?!.*\\.snap$)(?!.*/__test__/)(?!.*/__mocks__/)(?!.*/__snapshots__/).*\\.[tj]sx?"
              regex_paths: true
              config:
                trigger: "frontend-pipeline"
```

> **Note:** When `regex_paths: true`, all paths in that watch block must be valid regular expressions. Glob syntax (e.g. `**`) is not supported in regex mode.

For example, in the following configuration:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "**/*"
              skip_path: "folder/file"
              config:
                trigger: "pipeline-1"
            - path: "**/*"
              except_path: "folder/file"
              config:
                trigger: "pipeline-2"
            - path: "folder/file"
              config:
                trigger: "pipeline-3"
```

If a single execution modified `folder/file` only `pipeline-3` will be triggered. But if any other file is modified as well (thus matching `**/*`), `pipeline-1` will also be triggered, but not `pipeline-2`.

### `config`

This is a sub-section that provides configuration for running commands or triggering another pipeline when changes occur in the specified path. Configuration supports 3 different step types.

- [Trigger](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/trigger-step)
- [Command](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/command-step)
- [Group](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/step-types/group-step)
- [Conditionals](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/conditionals)

#### Step Validation

The plugin validates all step configurations before uploading the pipeline. Invalid steps are automatically skipped with a warning logged to the build output.

**A valid step must have:**
- A `command` or `commands` field (for command steps), OR
- A `trigger` field (for trigger steps), OR
- A `group` field with either:
  - An action (`command`, `commands`, or `trigger`) directly on the group, OR
  - Valid nested `steps`

**Invalid configurations that will be skipped:**

```yaml
# ❌ Empty step - no action defined
- path: "app/"
  config:
    label: "Deploy app"  # Only has a label, no command/trigger

# ❌ Empty group - no action and no nested steps
- path: "services/"
  config:
    group: "Deploy"
    # Missing: steps array or action
```

**Valid configurations:**

```yaml
# ✅ Valid - has command
- path: "app/"
  config:
    label: "Deploy app"
    command: "echo deploying"

# ✅ Valid - group with nested steps
- path: "services/"
  config:
    group: "Deploy"
    steps:
      - command: "deploy.sh"
```

#### Multiple steps per `config`

`config` can also be a list of step configs instead of a single object. Each entry becomes an independent generated step (they are **not** nested under an implicit group) — the same path/`skip_path`/`except_path` matching rules that apply to a single-object `config` apply equally to every entry in the list.

```yaml
- path: services/api/
  config:
    - command: "npm test"
      label: "Test API"
    - trigger: "api-deploy"
      label: "Deploy API"
```

When a file under `services/api/` changes, both the `npm test` command step and the `api-deploy` trigger step are generated as separate top-level steps.

#### `matrix`

A step's `config` can include a [build matrix](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/configure/workflows/build-matrix) via the `matrix` attribute. It is passed through untouched to the generated pipeline step.

```yaml
- path: services/api/
  config:
    command: "test.sh"
    matrix:
      setup:
        os: ["linux", "windows"]
```

#### Plugins in Step Configurations

The plugin preserves `plugins:` blocks when specified in command step configurations. This allows you to use Buildkite plugins within your monorepo-watched steps.

**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          watch:
            - path: services/api/
              config:
                command: "npm test"
                plugins:
                  - artifacts#v1.9.4:
                      upload: "coverage/**/*"
                  - docker-compose#v5.12.1:
                      run: api
            - path: services/web/
              config:
                command: "yarn build"
                plugins:
                  - docker#v5.13.0:
                      image: "node:20"
                      workdir: /app
```

When changes are detected in the watched paths, the plugin generates steps that include the specified plugins. The `plugins:` blocks are preserved exactly as configured.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          watch:
            - path: app/
              config:
                trigger: "app-deploy"
            - path: test/bin/
              config:
                command: "echo Make Changes to Bin"
            - path: docker/
              config:
                group: docker/**
                steps:  # Required: groups must have either 'steps' or an action
                  - plugins:
                      - docker#v5.13.0:
                          build: service
                          push: service
                  - command: docker/run-e2e-tests.sh
```

- Changes to the path `app/` triggers the pipeline `app-deploy`
- Changes to the path `test/bin` will run the respective configuration command
- Changes to any file in the docker folder will run the steps in the group

⚠️ Warning : The user has to explictly state the paths they want to monitor or use wildcards. For instance if a user, is only watching path `app/` changes made to `app/bin` will not trigger the configuration. This is because the subfolder `/bin` was not specified.

**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines with plugin"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          watch:
            - path: test/.buildkite/
              config: # Required [trigger step configuration]
                trigger: test-pipeline # Required [trigger pipeline slug]
            - path:
                - app/
                - app/bin/service/
              config:
                trigger: "data-generator"
                label: ":package: Generate data"
                build:
                  meta_data:
                    release-version: "1.1"
```

- When changes are detected in the path `test/.buildkite/` it triggers the pipeline `test-pipeline`
- If the changes are made to either `app/` or `app/bin/service/` it triggers the pipeline `data-generator`

**Conditional Step Execution (`if`):**

The plugin supports conditional execution of pipeline steps using the `if` key, matching Buildkite’s pipeline conditional syntax. The `if` key allows you to control when a step runs, based on branch names, environment variables, build metadata, or custom expressions.

**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines with plugin"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: git diff --name-only HEAD~1
          watch:
            - path: services/api
              config:
                trigger: deploy-api
                if: build.branch == 'main' || build.branch =~ /^release\//
            - path: services/web
              config:
                command: echo "Deploy Web"
                if: build.tag != null
```

In the example above,

- The `deploy-api` trigger will only run on the main branch or branches matching `release/*`.
- The `web deployment` command will run only if the build has a tag.

`if` also works at the group step level, controlling whether the entire group runs:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines with plugin"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: git diff --name-only HEAD~1
          watch:
            - path: services/
              config:
                group: "Deploy Services"
                if: build.branch == 'main'
                steps:
                  - command: deploy-uat.sh
                    label: Deploy UAT
                  - command: deploy-prod.sh
                    label: Deploy Prod
```

#### `diff` (optional)

This will run the script provided to determine the folder changes.
Depending on your use case, you may want to determine the point where the branch occurs
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527234/finding-a-branch-point-with-git> and perform a diff against the branch point.

Default: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`

The diff command must produce **newline-delimited output** with one file path per line. This is the format that `git diff --name-only` produces by default. Newline-delimited output is required for filenames containing spaces to be parsed correctly.

Custom diff scripts should follow the same convention — print one path per line to standard output.

The diff command can print suplementary output to standard error. This output will be shown in the step's log output when the log level is set to debug.

#### Sample output

```
README.md
lib/trigger.bash
directory/File Name With Spaces.md
```

#### Example scripts

`diff: ./diff-against-last-successful-build.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -ueo pipefail

LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_COMMIT="$(aws s3 cp "${S3_LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_COMMIT_PATH}" - | head -n 1)"
git diff --name-only "$LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_COMMIT"
```

`diff: ./diff-against-last-built-tag.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -ueo pipefail

LATEST_BUILT_TAG=$(git describe --tags --match foo-service-* --abbrev=0)
git diff --name-only "$LATEST_TAG"
```

**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                command: "echo deploy-bar"
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
```

#### `interpolation` (optional)

This controls the pipeline interpolation on upload, and defaults to `true`.
If set to `false` it adds `--no-interpolation` to the `buildkite pipeline upload`,
to avoid trying to interpolate the commit message, which can cause failures.

### `default` (optional)

A default `config` to run if no paths are matched, the `config` key is not required, so a `default` can be written with a `config` attribute or simple just a `command` or `trigger`.

**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                command: "echo deploy-bar"
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
            - default:
                config: ## <-- Optional
                  command: echo "Hello, world!"
```

### `env` (optional)

The object values provided in this configuration will be appended to `env` property of all steps or commands.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
                label: "Triggered deploy"
                build:
                  message: "Deploying foo service"
                  env:
                    HELLO: 123
                    AWS_REGION: ~  # Null literal reads from $AWS_REGION
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be specified in two formats. Both formats are fully supported.

#### Map Format (Recommended)

The map format provides clean, readable syntax:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          env:
            NODE_ENV: production
            API_URL: https://api.example.com
            PORT: 8080
            DEBUG: false
            AWS_REGION: ~         # Null literal reads from $AWS_REGION
            EMPTY_STRING: ""      # Empty string sets to literal ""
          watch:
            - path: "services/"
              config:
                command: "npm test"
                env:
                  TEST_ENV: integration
                  MAX_WORKERS: 4
```

Map format features:
- Clean YAML syntax using key-value pairs
- Supports non-string values (numbers, booleans) which are converted to strings automatically
- Null values read from OS environment: use `KEY: ~` (recommended YAML null literal)
- The explicit `~` ensures nothing is accidentally added during pipeline processing
- Note: Unlike array format, you cannot use just `KEY` alone - you must use a null value
- Empty string (`""`) is treated as a literal empty string value
- Whitespace in values is preserved
- Recommended for new configurations

#### Array Format (Fully Supported)

The array format uses key=value syntax:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          env:
            - NODE_ENV=production
            - API_URL=https://api.example.com
            - AWS_REGION          # Key-only reads from $AWS_REGION
          watch:
            - path: "services/"
              config:
                command: "npm test"
                env:
                  - TEST_ENV=integration
```

Array format features:
- Key-only entries (e.g., `AWS_REGION`) read from OS environment variables
- Supports values with equals signs: `BUILD_ARGS=--arg1=val1`
- Whitespace trimmed from keys and values automatically
- Fully supported alongside map format

#### Format Comparison

| Feature | Map Format | Array Format |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Syntax | `KEY: value` | `KEY=value` |
| OS env reading | Null literal (`KEY: ~`) | Key-only entries (`KEY`) |
| Empty string | `KEY: ""` sets to `""` | `KEY=` sets to `""` |
| Type support | Numbers, booleans | Strings only |
| Whitespace | Preserved in values | Trimmed |
| Readability | High | Medium |

**Note:** The format is determined by YAML structure - you cannot mix array and map syntax at the same level. However, you can use different formats at different levels (e.g., map format at plugin level, array format at step level).

### `log_level` (optional)

Add `log_level` property to set the log level. Supported log levels are `debug` and `info`. Defaults to `info`.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          log_level: "debug" # defaults to "info"
          watch:
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
```

### `download` (optional)

Default: `true`

By setting `download` to `false`, the plugin will use a pre-installed binary instead of downloading it on each run. The binary `monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin` must be available in your PATH (typically `/usr/bin`).

This option is useful for:
- Reducing build time by avoiding repeated downloads
- Improving security by using pre-vetted binaries
- Organizations with policies against runtime binary downloads

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          download: false
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
```

### Download Retry Behavior

The plugin automatically retries binary downloads up to 3 times with a 5-second delay between attempts. This handles transient network issues when downloading from GitHub.

### `verify_checksum` (optional)

Default: `false`

Enable SHA256 checksum verification for downloaded binaries to enhance security. When enabled, the plugin verifies checksums against those published in the GitHub release, providing protection against compromised artifacts, network attacks, and binary tampering.

Checksum verification is performed for:
- Newly downloaded binaries (fails and deletes binary on mismatch)
- Cached binaries before reuse (automatically re-downloads on mismatch)
- Pre-installed binaries when `download: false` (best-effort, non-blocking)

To enable checksum verification:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          verify_checksum: true  # Recommended for enhanced security
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
```

If checksums are unavailable for a release or the SHA256 command is not found on the system, the plugin will warn but continue execution (graceful degradation).

### `hooks` (optional)

Currently supports a list of `commands` you wish to execute after the `watched` pipelines have been triggered

```yaml
hooks:
  - command: upload unit tests reports
  - command: echo success
```

### `wait` (optional)

Default: `true`

By setting `wait` to `true`, the build will wait until the triggered pipeline builds are successful before proceeding

### `key` (optional)

Add `key` to set the step or group key.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Setting Key"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                key: echo-step
                command: "echo deploy-bar"
```

### `depends_on` (optional)

Add `depends_on` to declare step or group dependencies. Accepts a single key string or a list of keys.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Deploy"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                group: "Deploy Bar"
                depends_on: "build-bar"
                steps:
                  - command: "echo deploy-bar"
                    label: "Deploy Bar"
```

### `allow_dependency_failure` (optional)

Set `allow_dependency_failure: true` to allow a step or group to run even if the steps it `depends_on` have failed.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Deploy"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                group: "Deploy Bar"
                depends_on: "build-bar"
                allow_dependency_failure: true
                steps:
                  - command: "echo deploy-bar"
                    label: "Deploy Bar"
```

### `skip_on_no_changes` (optional)

By default, when a watch's `path` doesn't match any changed file, its step is omitted from the generated pipeline entirely. This can break a `depends_on` reference: if a downstream step depends on a step that was omitted, the reference never resolves and the build stalls or fails waiting on a step that was never created. The same applies when a watch is excluded via `except_path`, or every matching file is excluded via `skip_path`.

Set `skip_on_no_changes: true` at the plugin level to keep those steps in the pipeline instead of omitting them. Unmatched steps are still emitted, but marked with a `skip` reason instead. Buildkite creates a step carrying `skip` as a `broken` job, and treats a broken job as satisfying any `depends_on` reference to it — the same way it treats a step skipped by an `if` condition — so the reference still resolves.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          skip_on_no_changes: true
          watch:
            - path: "services/"
              config:
                group: "CI/CD Infrastructure"
                key: "group:cicd"
                steps:
                  - command: "echo deploy"
            - path: "app/"
              config:
                command: "echo build-app"
                depends_on: "group:cicd"
```

If `services/` doesn't match any changed file, `CI/CD Infrastructure` is still emitted with `skip: "No changes detected"` instead of vanishing, and `build-app`'s `depends_on: "group:cicd"` resolves correctly.

The skip reason reflects why the step was excluded:

- `No changes detected` — the watch's `path` didn't match any changed file.
- `Matched changes were excluded by skip_path` — a file matched `path`, but every match was also excluded by `skip_path`.
- `Excluded by except_path` — the watch was excluded entirely via `except_path`.

**Note on groups:** the plugin sets `skip:` on the group container itself in the generated YAML (as in the example above). Buildkite then applies that skip to every job nested inside the group, rather than treating the group as one single skipped unit — so an all-skipped group still renders as a visible group in the pipeline view, just with every job inside it shown as skipped, rather than the group disappearing.

**Note on `notify`:** enabling `skip_on_no_changes` can cause a plugin-level `notify` to fire on builds where nothing actually matched. Without the flag, a build where no watch matches and there's no `default` step uploads nothing, so `notify` never fires. With the flag on, that same build now uploads a pipeline containing only `skip:` placeholders, which is enough content for the upload to proceed and `notify` to trigger. If you rely on `notify` (for example a Slack webhook) to only fire on real activity, keep this in mind before enabling the flag.

### `notify` (optional)

Add `notify` to send notifications when a group step completes. Accepts the same notification types as Buildkite step-level notify.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Deploy"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                group: "Deploy Bar"
                notify:
                  - slack: "#deployments"
                    if: "build.state == 'passed'"
                steps:
                  - command: "echo deploy-bar"
                    label: "Deploy Bar"
```

### `secrets` (optional)

Add `secrets` to inject [Buildkite Secrets](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/security/secrets/buildkite-secrets) into your command steps. Secrets can be specified in two formats:

**Array format** - secret names are used as environment variable names:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Deploy with secrets"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "service/"
              config:
                command: "deploy.sh"
                secrets:
                  - API_ACCESS_TOKEN
                  - DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

**Map format** - specify custom environment variable names:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Deploy with secrets"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "service/"
              config:
                command: "deploy.sh"
                secrets:
                  MY_API_KEY: api_access_token_secret
                  DB_PASS: database_password_secret
```

Secrets also work within grouped steps:

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Deploy services"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "services/"
              config:
                group: "Deploy"
                steps:
                  - command: "deploy-uat.sh"
                    label: "Deploy UAT"
                    secrets:
                      - UAT_DB_HOST
                  - command: "deploy-prod.sh"
                    label: "Deploy Prod"
                    secrets:
                      DB_HOST: prod_db_host_secret
```

## Example

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          diff: "git diff --name-only $(head -n 1 last_successful_build)"
          interpolation: false
          env:
            env1: env-1  # this will be appended to all env configuration
          hooks:
            - command: "echo $(git rev-parse HEAD) > last_successful_build"
          watch:
            - path:
                - "ops/terraform/"
                - "ops/templates/terraform/"
              config:
                command: "buildkite-agent pipeline upload ops/.buildkite/pipeline.yml"
                label: "Upload pipeline"
                key: pipeline-upload
                # following configs are available in command. notify is not available in trigger step
                notify:
                  - basecamp_campfire: https://basecamp-url
                  - github_commit_status:
                      context: my-custom-status
                  - slack: "@someuser"
                    if: build.state === "passed"
                # soft_fail: true
                soft_fail:
                  - exit_status: 1
                  - exit_status: "255"
                retry:
                  automatic:
                    - limit: 2
                      exit_status: -1
                agents:
                  queue: performance
                artifacts:
                  - "logs/*"
                env:
                  FOO: bar

          wait: true
```

**Note:** This plugin accepts both `artifact_paths` and `artifacts` field names for backward compatibility:

```yaml
# Preferred - use "artifact_paths":
- path: "app/"
  config:
    command: "npm test"
    artifact_paths:
      - "logs/**/*"

# Also supported - "artifacts":
- path: "app/"
  config:
    command: "npm test"
    artifacts:
      - "logs/**/*"
```

Both field names are supported by Buildkite. The generated pipeline YAML will use `artifact_paths`.

### `binary_folder` (optional)

Default: `BUILDKITE_PLUGINS_PATH`

This is the filesystem folder where the Go binary will be kept.

## Example
```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monorepo-diff#v1.11.3:
          binary_folder: "/var/buildkite-agent"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                key: echo-step
                command: "echo deploy-bar"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Skipping invalid step" warnings

If you see warnings like `Skipping invalid step: empty step configuration`, check that your step configuration includes:

1. For command steps: `command` or `commands` field
2. For trigger steps: `trigger` field
3. For group steps: `group` field with either `steps` array or an action

**Common issues:**

- Forgetting to add `command:` or `trigger:` inside the `config` block
- Creating empty groups without nested steps
- Using only metadata fields like `label`, `key`, or `env` without an action

**Example of fixing an invalid configuration:**

```yaml
# ❌ Invalid - missing action
- path: "app/"
  config:
    label: "Deploy app"
    env:
      - ENV=production

# ✅ Fixed - added command
- path: "app/"
  config:
    label: "Deploy app"
    command: "deploy.sh"
    env:
      - ENV=production
```
